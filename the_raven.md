Once upon a midnight [ADJECTIVE], while I pondered [ADJECTIVE] and [ADJECTIVE],
Over many a quaint and curious [NOUN] of forgotten [NOUN],
While I [VERB], nearly napping, suddenly there came a [NOUN],
As of [NOUN] gently rapping, rapping at my [LOCATION] door.
"Tis some [NOUN]," I muttered, "tapping at my [LOCATION] door -
Only this, and nothing more."

Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the [ADJECTIVE] December,
And each separate [NOUN] ember wrought its [NOUN] upon the floor.
Eagerly I [VERB] the morrow; - [ADVERB] I had sought to borrow
From my [NOUN] surcease of sorrow - sorrow for the [ADJECTIVE] Lenore -
For the [ADJECTIVE] and [ADJECTIVE] maiden whom the angels named [NAME] -
Nameless here for evermore.
